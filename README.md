# Meteorological data analysis workflow with OGC web services | UEF 2017 meeting

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks as material for an interactive session on OGC web services for meteorological data during UEF (Using ECMWF Forecasts) 2017 meeting. 
The interactive demo was held on Thursday, 15 June 2017 at 11:50 - 12:50 and 14:00 to 15:00.

NOTE:
Unfortuantely, the service the examples are based on was switched off. The examples however still give an idea how requests of an OGC Web Coverage Service are set up and can be integrated into the geospatial analysis workflow.
